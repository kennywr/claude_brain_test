## Project Status
Converting web-based cognitive testing app to React Native/Expo mobile app.

## Tasks

### ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Analyze existing web app structure and identify core components
- [x] Set up React Native navigation structure with tabs for Dashboard, Tests, and History
- [x] Create AsyncStorage-based data persistence system for test results
- [x] Convert Reaction Time test to React Native components
- [x] Convert 2-Back working memory test to React Native
- [x] Convert Digit Span test to React Native
- [x] Convert Stroop test to React Native
- [x] Implement dashboard with test overview and progress charts
- [x] Test app functionality and fix any mobile-specific issues (basic testing complete)
- [x] Set up git repository and GitHub integration
- [x] Add Animal Naming Test (MoCA-based visual recognition test)
- [x] Expand Animal Naming Test to 200+ animals with advanced features:
  - [x] Created comprehensive animal database (50 core + 150+ extended animals)
  - [x] Implemented difficulty categorization system (Easy/Medium/Hard)
  - [x] Added multiple test modes (MoCA/Extended/Adaptive/Random)
  - [x] Built image caching and optimization system with Expo Image
  - [x] Created test configuration screen with user progress tracking
  - [x] Implemented adaptive difficulty algorithm
  - [x] Added difficulty-weighted scoring system
  - [x] Built user progress tracking and statistics

### üîÑ Next Priority
- [ ] Create history view with charts using react-native-chart-kit

### ‚è≥ Pending
- [ ] Add proper styling and mobile-optimized UI components

## Test Components Built
1. **Reaction Time** - Touch response speed measurement ‚úÖ
2. **2-Back** - Working memory test with letter sequences ‚úÖ
3. **Digit Span** - Memory span test with number sequences ‚úÖ
4. **Stroop** - Attention/inhibition test with color-word conflicts ‚úÖ
5. **Animal Naming** - Enhanced visual recognition test with 200+ animals ‚úÖ
   - Multiple test modes (MoCA/Extended/Adaptive/Random)
   - Difficulty-based scoring and adaptive progression
   - Comprehensive animal database with image caching
   - User progress tracking and personalized recommendations

## Technical Notes
- Using React Navigation for tab structure
- AsyncStorage for local data persistence
- react-native-chart-kit for progress visualization
- Touch-optimized UI components
